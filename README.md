# Daily Reflections Blog

## Powered by Jekyll and Github Pages

**Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

The goal of this project is to give you a place to log your daily reflections from class. Each day should be a new post in the `_posts` directory. If you follow the naming and conventions for Jekyll, things will work like magic!

The assignment to get this blog set up requires that you customize the `index.html` and `about.html` files, add a post about your reflections, and edit the `_config.yml` file with your own information.
